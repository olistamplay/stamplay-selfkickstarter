stamplay-selfkickstarter
===================

**This project is built on the [Stamplay](https://stamplay.com) platform and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to show you how to build a landing page to raise funds leveraging Stripe integration, similar to [KickStarter](http://kickstarter.com) but done in the blink of an eye.**

*Kickstarter is the world’s largest funding platform for creative projects. It was founded in 2009 and by March 2014 the platform had received pledges totalling more than $1bn.*

In this project we’ll build a crowdfunding landing page that will allow you to start collecting money from your own website. We call it, Self Starter!

We’ll be using AngularJS to manage the front-end, and we’ll include the following features:

* Guest users can signup with Facebook
* Logged users can donate a fixed amount for you project
* Admins can set a goal for the campaign
* Admins can see all payment details via Stripe’s dashboard

[This is what you'll build](https://kickstarter.stamplayapp.com/).
